Kotlin code reference

- in kotlin to create a list you need to declare the type of variable as a list and use the listOf function with the values within. you also have to declare the type of value that will be saved in the list
  
  var testlist : List<Int> = listOf(1,2,3)

- Pairs: pairs are a data type in Kotlin that has two values first and last. so it is declared as a pair and the values can be accessed by destructuring or by using the first and last elements
  you also have to privde the type of data that the pair will store

  var testpair : Pair<Int, Int> = Pair(12,1)
