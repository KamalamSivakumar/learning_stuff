we will be using android studio to create an app

- install all the required stuff with android studio and set it up ( fairly straight forward. If not check the docs bro )
- enable developer options on your mobile and connect it to your laptop via usb cable. and enable usb debugging in the developer options
- create a new project with whichever template you want.
  - one additional thing you will have to do is setup the build tools version and the android sdk version. This is setup by going to the file option and project structure. go to modules panel and in the properties tab select the version whichever you have installed and is the latest one
- now build the code and the device should show up in the run options. Click on run and the app will run on the android device.
