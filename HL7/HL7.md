HL7 - Health Level 7

HL7 is a set of standards to communicate with other health systems and ensure data consistency.

These include messages sent when a patient is registered, a patient takes a scan, pays a bill and everything is stored in the HIS( Hospital Information System ), RIS( Radiology Information System ).

Not all systems know how to speak the HL7 language. So an interface needs to be built such that each system can communicate with each other

Instead of writing custom interfaces, engines can be used that perform the same task.
There are two types of engines. interface engine and integration engine.
