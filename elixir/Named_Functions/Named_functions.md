Once code grows beyond a point, it needs to be structured and named for ease of access. code is broken down into named functions and arranged in modules. Named functions NEED to be written inside modules.


in [times.exs](./times.exs) we have defined a module called Times and a single function double which doubles the value thats given. since the number of arguments is a part of the way we identify functions, it is written as double/1
