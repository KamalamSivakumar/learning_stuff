Mix is a tool used for creating full fledged elixir applications.

The application we are going to build acts as a distributed key-value store. At the end we are going to build a client that can talk to all the nodes and send commands like CREATE, PUT, GET


for this we are going to use
- OTP - Open Telecom Platform which is a set of tools on erlang.
- Mix - Mix is a build tool that has tasks for creating managing and testing applications.
- ExUnit - a test unit based framework that ships with Elixir


I probably will have full learnings on the other repo.

I will add changes here( maybe )







I have the repository where I created the app at https://github.com/cosmoglint/mix_hex
The original source code by Jose valim is at https://github.com/josevalim/kv_umbrella
