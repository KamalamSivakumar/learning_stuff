WHY math:

  engineers who want to push the boundaries. Basically math unlocks a loot of cool tools that make programming fun and captivating

HOW:
  The math culture is complicated and terse with no proper documentation. Its like writing a software that is groundbreaking yet backward compatible with hundreds of years of ideas
  The main idea is to be able to handle abstract concepts and persist with papers.first we start by understanding some bosic building blocks of math and build on top of that ond go however deep one likes or needs
  being able to read and write proofs. math revolves around proofs and they are the primary vehicle of insight


We are not trying to meet some abstract production quota of definitions, theorems and proofs. The measure of our success is whether what we do enables people to understand and think more clearly and effectively about mathematics.
