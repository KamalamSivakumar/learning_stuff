Here are the basic stuff to be done with awk


awk files are run with the -f flag to point to the awk program file


usage:

awk -f the_awk_file_name.awk file_to_perform.txt



you can also use the shell file specified that runs the awk file you choose automatically on the usr_bin_data.txt file which is what the programs are written for
